#  Garry's Mod Commit Tracker

## What is this?
This is a discord bot that will send commit messages (from:https://commits.facepunch.com/r/Garrys%20Mod) to a dedicated channel in your discord. This is useful if you want to stay update to date with Garry's Mod developement with very little effort :)

Coming soon: Facepunch Commit tracker - this bot will be refactored into a generic facepunch commit tracker with more functionality.

## Info
If you delete the channel you assigned and a commit comes through; your guild will be deleted from the list and you will be notified to re-add a channel. This is also true if the Bot doesn't have permission to write to the channel.

Feel free to clone the bot yourself and self-host.

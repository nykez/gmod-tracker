# DiscordBotBase

This repository contains blank templates to create a bot using Discord.Net 1.0

It is recommended to read the [official documentation] before using these templates, so that you
are familiar with the library first.

It is also recommended to take a look at the [example bots] if you are unfamiliar with the library.

This repository contains two working branches: `csharp` and `vb`, which will each contain their
own version of the templates, for both C#7 and Visual Basic, respectively.
